       <h4>Description</h4>
       <p>I have to protect Shōgawa-san’s secret…!
<br /><br />
My classmate Shōgawa-san has a secret that no one must uncover──
<br /><br />
That’s right, she is actually a Radiant Magical Girl that protect this city! (And she’s super cute～!)
<br /><br />
I found out this secret by accident, and to avoid her identity from being exposed, I vow to cover up for her, but she is a really clumsy ditz!
<br /><br />
In order to better support her, I must be mentally prepared to stay by her side at all times…
<br /><br />
「Shōgawa-san! Please stay with me (Physically)!」「Oh, Okay.」
<br /><br />
Great! Now we can have lunch together, go home after school together, visit the amusement park together──
<br /><br />
As a support type character, my support will be flawless!
<br /><br />
…Hmm? A couple? No no no, There Is No Way a Support Type Character Will Have a Girlfriend.
<br /><br />
A love comedy of misunderstandings and lack of self awareness, is now screening!</p>
